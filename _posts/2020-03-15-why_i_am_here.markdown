I heard stories of many software engineers who always knew they were going to work with computers because they started tinkering with them when they were kids, or their parents bought a computer and they picked up coding and concluded that they enjoyed it. I just seemed so simple for them to continue to do the same things they did as a child. It is a familiar path for them. All these examples are very common for software engineers but for me the path was not as simple. 

I grew up with dial-up and a very annoying parental block. I hardly had any say in what I could view. As I got older my mom finally bought a laptop for us, however sharing a computer with 3 other people is definitely a lot harder than you might think. Fast-forward a few years my dad worked at an IT help desk at the time and for my 15 birthday he built me my own personal desktop. I remember seeing him installing the operating system that looked completely different from the Windows vista and Windows XP I was used to. He explained that this operating system was called Linux. This was news to me! Watching him go through the process to build something from spare parts, and to actually have it in completely operational condition amazed me. Its not like I didn’t believe he could do it. I’ve just never seen something like this done. It’s like watching the cotton go from the field to the weaving factory just to make your favorite shirt. Something that never occurs to people is the journey products took before they were placed in front of you.

I didn't do any programming until after completing my basics at a local community college. I began with java, which was interesting, and I could do it but had very little motivation to go beyond basics. I tried children games like "poke the pig." I also tried books from the library. That still didn't really motivate me.

It was when I thought about coming back to school that I had an realization. I considered all the steps it would take to complete my degree in computer science...was it worth the copious amounts of money? What about all the unnecessary classes I would inevitably be forced to take.  “Isn't there a better way?" That’s when I began researching web development classes.


I didn't become a software engineer because I enjoyed coding or grew up around computers or any of that. I wanted to do exactly what my dad did with my computer, but in my own way. I became a software engineer because I want to create the solution to many of the issues people care about.
