--> For my CLI project I started out with so many ideas. The only thing I hadn't anticipated was how much time it would take just to work out how to make my dreams come true. I spent days and countless articles for research to give myself an understanding of what to write and how it works.

--> My downfall was not being open to switching gears, and essentially changing up my idea. I was so focused on sticking with my great idea. I cut corners and tried to make it work anyway I can. As a result of this narrow sight I believe I missed out possibly creating something better. 

--> On the other side of my disappointment, I learned quite a lot more just by writing the code and failing than I ever did reading about it. Being the stubborn person I am, I am excited to continue this project. I look forward to expanding my knowledge to make it better. All of my ideas are still saved in my notes. My task now is to find out how to execute it. 

--> I am ready for the challenge!!!
