After highschool I spent most of my time asking myself " what do I do next?" Honestly, back then I couldn't answer that question. That was obviously the case  just like most other 18 year olds. In this time I worked as a nanny, and did tons of research on dead end topics, because I enjoy learning new things. The positive thing about that year and a half is that I learned things about myself and made peace with my faults.

Skipping ahead to college.   
 
 I got my basics out of the way and I still couldn't begin to answer my first question. I tried many different avenues to seek any kind of answer I could. However, in the end I just choose to make money so I could atleast leave my parents house. I chased money for three years, and never felt fulfilled. There was always a reason to be unhappy in my job, then would inevitability quit. After some time wasting, and moving back home I decided to actually get serious about my future. 
  
Now at 23...
	
I know what I like and the things that I don't. I know that I dont truly feel fufilled untill i've used my creative ability to create something. I enjoy projects and technology and convenience. I want to create with innovative designs to make life easier for others around me. 
	
Ultimately  i've come to the conclusion what i do next isn't relevant. What I should have asked myself is " How do I help?" I had a chat with some friends a while ago who told me tech is the future so I listened, then I researched. 

I haven't looked back since.
